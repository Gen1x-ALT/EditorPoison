# About
Do you think your PenguinMod editing experience is too basic? Too normal even? Well, fear no more. With this extension, you can now completely FUCK UP the editor! 

It's recommended to go through this without seeing the code first, as this extension executes different actions in different order each time you use it.

To do that, you can download it from the file directly without seeing the contents: [Download Editor Poison](/poison.html){: .btn}

Import the extension unsandboxed.
